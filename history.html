            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Research has found animals can have an overall positive effect on health and improve mood and quality of
                life. The positive effect has been linked to the human-animal bond. In a variety of settings, such as
                prisons, nursing homes, and mental institutions, animals are used to assist people with different
                disabilities or disorders.
            </p>
            <p>
                In modern times animals are seen as "agents of socialization" and as providers of "social support and
                relaxation". The earliest reported use of the therapy for the mentally ill took place in the late 18th
                century at the York Retreat in England, led by William Tuke. Patients at this facility were allowed to
                wander the grounds which contained a population of small domestic animals. These were believed to be
                effective tools for socialization. In 1860, the Bethlem Hospital in England followed the same trend and
                added animals to the ward, greatly influencing the morale of the patients living there.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in other pieces of literature it states that animal-assisted therapy was used as early as 1792
                at the Quaker Society of Friends York Retreat in England. Velde, Cipriani & Fisher also state "Florence
                Nightingale appreciated the benefits of pets in the treatment of individuals with illness."

            <h2>Therapeutic use</h2>
            <p>
                The US military promoted the use of dogs as a therapeutic intervention with psychiatric patients in 1919
                at St Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, DC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sigmund Freud kept many dogs and often had his chow Jofi present during his pioneering sessions of
                psychoanalysis. He noticed that the presence of the dog was helpful because the patient would find that
                their speech would not shock or disturb the dog and this reassured them and so encouraged them to relax
                and confide. This was most effective when the patient was a child or adolescent.
                <br>
                Modern animal-assisted therapy may have been influenced by attachment theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Increased recognition of the value of humanâ€“pet bonding was noted by Dr. Boris M. Levinson in 1961.
                Levinson accidentally used animals in therapy with children when he left his dog alone with a difficult
                child, and upon returning, found the child talking to the dog.
