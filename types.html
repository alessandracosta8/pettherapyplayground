            <h2>Canine-assisted therapy</h2>
            <p>
                In canine-assisted therapy, therapy dogs interact with clients in animal assisted interventions, to
                enhance therapeutic activities and well-being including the physical, cognitive, behavioral and
                socio-emotional functioning of clients. Well-trained therapy dogs exhibit the behavior that
                human clients construe as friendly and welcoming. They comfort clients via body contact. Therapy
                dogs are also required to possess a calm temperament for accommodating the contact with unfamiliar
                clients while they serve as a source of comfort. They promote patients engaging in interactions
                which can help patient improve motor skills and establish trusting relationship with others. The
                interaction between patients and therapy dogs also aids reducing stressful and anxious feelings patients
                have. Due to those benefits, canine-assisted therapy is used as a complement to other therapies to
                treat diagnosis such as post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism
                spectrum disorder, and dementia.

            <h2>Dolphin therapy</h2>
            <p>
                Dolphin-assisted therapy refers to the controversial alternative medicine practice of swimming with
                dolphins. This form of therapy has been strongly criticized as having no long-term benefit, and
                being based on flawed observations. Psychologists have cautioned that dolphin-assisted therapy is
                not known to be effective for any condition and that it presents considerable risks to both human
                patients and the captive dolphins. The child has a one-on-one session with a therapist in a marine
                park of some kind. An ethical issue with data on dolphin-assisted therapy and the effectiveness of
                it is that most of the research is done by people who operate the dolphin-assisted therapy programs.

            <h2>Equine-related therapy</h2>
            <p>
                A distinction exists between hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding. The American Hippotherapy
                Association defines hippotherapy as a physical, occupational, and speech-language therapy treatment
                strategy that utilizes equine movement as part of an integrated intervention program to achieve
                functional outcomes, while the Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International
                defines therapeutic riding as a riding lesson specially adapted for people with special needs.
                According to Marty Becker, hippotherapy programs are active "in twenty-four countries and the horse's
                functions have expanded to therapeutic riding for people with physical, psychological, cognitive,
                social, and behavioral problems".â€Š Hippotherapy has also been approved by the American Speech
                and Hearing Association as a treatment method for individuals with speech disorders.

            <h2>Pig therapy</h2>
            <p>
                Pigs have been used in various types of animal-assisted therapy to perform duties in facilities
                including airports, hospitals, nursing homes, and special-needs schools, or as emotional
                support animals for individuals with conditions such as autism or anxiety and veterans with
                PTSD. Two well-known miniature pigs named Thunder and Bolt trained by children to certified animal
                therapy status have been put to work in a number of nursing homes, schools and a hospital.
