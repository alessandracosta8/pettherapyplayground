                <p class="justified-paragraph">
                    Edward O. Wilson's (1984) biophilia hypothesis is based on the premise that our attachment to and
                    interest in animals stems from the strong possibility that human survival was partly dependent on
                    signals from animals in the environment indicating safety or threat. The biophilia hypothesis
                    suggests that if we see animals at rest or in a peaceful state, this may signal to us safety,
                    security and feelings of well-being which in turn may trigger a state where personal change and
                    healing are possible.
                    Six neurotransmitters that influence mood have been documented to release after a 15-minute or more
                    interaction with animals. Mirror neuron activity and disease-perception through olfactory (smelling)
                    ability in dogs may also play important roles in helping dogs connect with humans during therapeutic
                    encounters.

        <h2 class="text-centered">Medical Use</h2>
        <p class="full-width">
            Animals can be used in settings such as prisons, nursing homes, mental institutions, and in the home.
            The techniques used depend on the needs and condition of the patient. Assistance dogs can support
            certain life activities and help people navigate outside the home.

            Assessing whether a program is effective as far as its outcomes are concerned is easier when the goals
            are clear and are able to be specified. There are a range of goals for animal assisted therapy programs
            relevant to children and young people, including enhanced capacity to form positive relationships with
            others. It is understood that pets provide benefits to those with mental health conditions, but further
            research is required to test the nature and extent of this relationship with an animal as a pet and how
            it differs between pets, emotional support animals, service animals, and animal-assisted therapy.

                Pediatric care
            </h3>
            <p>
                Therapists rely on techniques such as monitoring a child's behavior with the animal, their tone of
                voice, and indirect interviewing. Animal-assisted therapy can be used in children with mental health
                problems, as a stand-alone treatment, or along with conventional methods. Animals can also help improve children's moods and reinforce positive behaviors while helping to decrease negative ones. Most commonly reported research results are decreased anxiety and pain within the pediatric population. Dogs have shown to increase comfort and decrease pain in pediatric palliative care.

                Prisons
            </h3>
            <p>
                Animal-assistance programs may be useful in prisons to relieve stress of the inmates and workers, or to provide other benefits, but further study is needed to confirm the effectiveness of such programs in these settings. Internal file data reviews, anecdotal stories, and surveys of inmate and staff
                perceptions have been used to gauge the effectiveness of animal-assisted therapy in prisons, but these
                methods are limited and have resulted in an inadequate assessment.

                The findings offer proof of the concept that canine-assisted therapies are feasible and can elicit
                positive quality-of-life experiences in institutionalized people with dementia. Researchers and
                practitioners need to elucidate the theoretical foundations of animal-assisted therapies. The Lived
                Environment Life Quality Model may serve as a guide for client-centered, occupation-focused, and
                ecologically valid approaches to animal-assisted occupational therapy beyond people with dementia.
